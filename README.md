## üèõÔ∏è Overview

Welcome to the official repository for the Jason Wang University (JWU) Interactive Portal. This project represents the digital forefront of JWU, an institution ambiguously founded on April 1, 2025, dedicated to the principles of extreme self-reliance and the masterful avoidance of conventional academic rigor.

This web application serves as the primary interface for prospective and current students, embodying the university's unique philosophy through interactive features and carefully curated information. Built with foundational web technologies, it offers a glimpse into the unparalleled experience of self-directed "learning" at JWU.

## üìú About & Mission

Founded amidst midterm meltdowns and failed social connections, JWU steadfastly avoids innovation, catering to the extremely self-reliant and socially confused. It thrives as an immaterial entity centered around the student's immediate environment (dorm table goo, coffee shop detritus, park benches). This spirit of "shitism" defines JWU as a proudly wild-listed institution technically accepting anyone.

**Mission Statement:**

> Jason Wang University's name and spirit are derived from one man's valiant efforts to minimize external obligations. The university exists entirely within the student's radius of hardware and instant caffeine (or marijuana high if you are in California and Canada), all of which are magnets for shunning talented, ambitious individuals.
>
> Thriving within strict personal boundaries and spanning zero verifiable disciplines, JWU has become the world's most minimalist platform for circumventing the challenges of learning, teaching, researching, building knowledge, and inventing new ways to ignore the human condition. Its students draw strength from the stimulating power of unfiltered internet access by mastering procrastination, barely expressing themselves online, and excelling at avoiding demanding careers. Jason Wang University's mission is to be a cozy, bottom-tier international hub. This includes not retaining any faculty, encouraging students to create projects that attract no funding, and providing an environment of intellectual void. Jason Wang University seeks to leverage the academic disadvantage of its completely inconvenient location and embrace uniformity to ensure a single, unwavering point of view in the educational void.
